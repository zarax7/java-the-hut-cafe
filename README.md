### **Getting Started**

https://sd3kim.github.io/futurama-man/

Users can browse through the menu page to select a hot/cold drink or fresh baked good, with options to select a size or customize the drink to your liking! The cart page will allow users to view their added items, with the option to remove if desired. When the user is all set to check out, the 'Order' button can be pressed displaying a nice "Thank You" message and showing the contents of the order.

---

### **Next Steps**

- Show total cost of order
- Quantity button (won't show repeated items but increase their quantity)
- OAUTH
